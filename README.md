# MyExprimentalNNs
Contains NNs created mostly for experimental or learning purposes

- A Neural Network w/o a hidden layer can mimic AND, OR, NAND and NOR gates i.e. all logical opertaions where the data can be linearly separated.

- A  Neural Network with a hidden layer can mimic logical operations where data is not linearly separable eg. XNOR gate.
